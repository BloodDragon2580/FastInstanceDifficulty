# FastInstanceDifficulty
Shows the current instance difficulty on your Titan Panel display.

This addon shows you the difficulty level of the instance in the TitanPanel. 
This means you can remove the standard symbol on the minimap and you have a 
little more space on the minimap again. 
However, the minimap symbol must be removed with another addon, e.g. SexyMaps. 
This is not possible with this plugin for TitanPanel.
